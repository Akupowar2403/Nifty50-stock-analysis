Overview
This backend project offers a FastAPI-powered REST API to fetch, store, and analyze historical stock data for India's NIFTY 50 index using Yahoo Finance data.
All historical data is stored in a local SQLite database and processed via SQLAlchemy, enabling robust storage and efficient technical analysis.

Features
Automated Data Fetching: Loads 3 months of daily prices for NIFTY 50 stocks via yfinance.

Persistent Storage: Stores all prices and indicators in SQLite using an efficient, normalized schema.

Technical Indicators: Calculates 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), daily percent returns, and volume analysis.

REST API: Clean endpoints for listing, price history, and indicator-driven stock analysis.

Validated Data: Uses Pydantic models to ensure safe API contracts and database integrity.

Auto Data Cleaning: Includes automatic repair of database entries with missing company names.

Interactive Documentation: Built-in Swagger and ReDoc API docs.
